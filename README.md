This inmate time served calculator (application) is a self-contained, all-in-one solution where the entire interface and functionality are embedded within a single HTML file.
It uses HTML for the user interface and JavaScript for the calculation logic, ensuring that everything is contained in one file, without external dependencies.

The calculations are based on various statutes specific to Oregon (ORS).

I've created this respository for any other counties that may be interested or find it useful.
