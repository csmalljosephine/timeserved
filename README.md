This inmate time served calculator (application) is a self-contained, all-in-one solution where the entire interface and functionality are embedded within a single HTML file.
It uses HTML for the user interface and JavaScript for the calculation logic, and report-temp.html with report.css for a printer friendly printable view - ensuring that everything is contained,
with the only dependency being any (probably) web browser.

The calculations are based on various statutes specific to Oregon (ORS). In most instances, those should be referenced in comments.

I've created this respository for any other counties that may be interested or find it useful. If you do find it useful, awesome!
