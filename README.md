Originally created in 2004, this inmate time served calculator is a self-contained, all-in-one application, with both the interface and functionality integrated within a single HTML file. 
It utilizes HTML for the user interface and JavaScript for the calculation logic, along with a printer-friendly view through 'report-temp.html' and 'report.css', ensuring compatibility with any web browser as the only required dependency.

Despite its age, the application remains in active use with minimal maintenance over the years. The calculations are based on various Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS), with most references included in the comments for clarity.

This repository is available for other counties that may find it helpful. If you do, that's fantastic!
